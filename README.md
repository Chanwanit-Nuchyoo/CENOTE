# What is CE NOTE?ðŸ“š

CE Note is a website that offers a summary of the Faculty of Engineering's course notes. The notes are brief and easy to comprehend. The CE community also features a web-based comments system where students may ask questions about things they don't grasp. Please note that this is the demo project for Software Development Process (Y2/2) Computer Engineering KMITL.



## How does it work? ðŸ“Œ

There are two types of systems in CE NOTE. 

1. Visitors - The notes are available in both a free and a paid version for visitors to peruse. Premium, on the other hand, requires visitors to pay to see all pages.
2. Creator- Note Creator may create both free and premium notes, and money will be sent to the creator's credit card linked to the website.
